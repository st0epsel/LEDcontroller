## LEDcontroller

Passion project to controll a bunch of RGB LED's in my room. I'm controlling the three HSV color channels with a single rotary encoder with a build in push-switch with which i rotate through the channels. The software runs on an ArduinoNano and has been mostly written by me (with some generous help of Gemini).
